Instructions: 

1) After cloning the repo, open the 'frontend' folder and the 'backend' folder in seperate terminals

2) In both the frontend and backend terminals run "npm install" to install all necessary node modules

3) In the backend terminal run "node server.js" to initialize the backend.

4) In the frontend terminal run "npm run start" to initialize the frontend.

Thank you.
